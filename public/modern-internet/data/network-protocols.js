document.getElementById("par3").innerHTML = 'Ethernet so far is the most used network protocols nowadays. It uses an access method called CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection). In this system, the computers check and listen first to the cable before sending anything through the network. It will continue to send if the network is clear but if some other nodes have already transmitted to it, it will wait and send only when the line is clear.';
document.getElementById("par4").innerHTML = 'Local Talk is a network protocol that was developed by Apple Computer, Inc. for Macintosh computers. The method used by Local Talk is called CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance).Local Talk is similar to CSMA/CD except that it does sends a signal for its intention before actually sending it.';
document.getElementById("par5").innerHTML = 'The Token Ring protocol was developed by IBM in the mid-1980s. The access method used involves token-passing. In this network protocol, the signal travels in a circular path from one computer to another in a logical ring. A single electronic token moves around the ring from one computer to the next. If a computer does not have information to transmit, it simply passes the token on to the next workstation. If a computer wishes to transmit and receives an empty token, it attaches data to the token. The token then proceeds around the ring until it comes to the computer for which the data is meant. At this point, the data is captured by the receiving computer.';
document.getElementById("par6").innerHTML = 'Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is a network protocol that is used primarily to interconnect two or more local area networks, often over large distances. It uses a dual ring physical topology. In this protocol, the transmission occurs only in one of the ring but if break occurs, information automatically uses portions of the second ring to create a new complete ring.';
