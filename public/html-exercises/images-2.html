        <h2>Story of my Life</h2>
        <br/>
        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/"><img src="Images/Childhood.jpg"width="150" alt="child" align="right"/></a> <p> When I was a child, my mother took care of me while my father is working. i have an older brother and we often play that usually leads to a fight. Since I was younger, he was always being scolded by our mother and most of the time, I felt guilty for that. We go to the same schoool far from our home. We have our own vehicle that sends us to school. I also have my gradnmother as my companion when I was young becasuse according to their story, I was very hard headed that time and don't want to go to school alone. My childhood days was okay but I haven't been satisfied because my mother and gradnmother was strict. They don't want me to play outside because I might get hurt. Sometimes, I sneek out to play with other kids and whenever I had wounds, they scolded me and then they will become more strict than before.</p>

        <a href="images-1.html"><img src='Images/Current.jpg'width="150" alt="c" align="right" /></a> <p> Today, I am currently studying at UPLB and I am pursuing Bachelor of Science in Agribusiness Management. I can say that I am enjoying my stay here in UPLB because of the good ambiance of the place. I am staying in a dormitory and it is a challenge for me to live independently far from my parents and other family member. At firs, I always felt lonely and I wanted to go home but as time passed by, I learned to control my emotion and focus in my study while in UPLB.</p>

        <a href="http://www.google.com.ph"><img src="Images/Future.jpg" width="150" alt="fut" align="left"/></a> <p> I am looking forward to become a successful manager or businesswoman someday. I also want to establish my own business so that I can provide job to our countrymen. I can help our country to decrease the number of unemployed citizens. I will attain this goal by studying well and applying all the concepts and other related knowledge in my chosen field.</p>
