    <h3>Top 3 Favorite Movies</h3>
    The third spot goes to <a href= "https://youtu.be/yVkrPH48k_I">Nim's Island</a> <p>Nim's Island movie shows an image of very beautiful island existing in the world. I like this movie simply because when I was a child, I am limited to explore and this movie opened my eyes to imagine great things beyond what I can see in our neighborhood.
    </p>
    The second spot goes to <a href="https://youtu.be/GE5aHKJp6HI">Spy Kids</a> <p>Spy Kids is a science fiction movie that leads me to dream of a profession similar to the main actors in the movie. When I was young, I wanted to be a spy and of course it didn't happen because my decisions in life is changing as I grew up. This movie was one of the most awesome movies I watched when I was I kid and so this is one of my favorite.
    </p>
    Finally, my number one pick is <a href="https://youtu.be/zWKwat0kpko">G.I. Joe 2: Retaliation</a> <p>I like this movie because I love watching action movies when there is the presence of a woman who is also one of the main character. I like to watch how this woman fight among men and how she could win the battle against them.

    <h3>Top 3 Favorite Songs</h3>
    The third spot goes to <a href="https://youtu.be/WIm1GgfRz6M">Superheroes</a> <p>This is one of my favorite songs because whenever I listen to it, I am refresh. During bad times, I always listen to this song because it makes me feel stronger and somewhat pursuing me to fight and never give up to whatever weakens my spirit.
    </p>
    The second spot goes to <a href="https://youtu.be/WIm1GgfRz6M">Look How High We Can Fly</a> <p>This song is full of magic not only because it was used in Barbie movie but because whenever I listen to this song, it takes me to space. A space where I can imagine all the good things and see it clearly.
    </p>
    My number one song is <a href="https://youtu.be/HJBXt21VpJ8">Your Guardian Angel </a> <p>This is one of my favorite songs because the voice of the singer was very good. As he sang, I felt like he was just near beside me and that I felt secure. This song is good to dedicate to someone you love and this will gives you the impression of being sweet and caring.
