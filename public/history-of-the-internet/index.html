        <p> The first world computer was used during the World War II and was called computing machines. These machines are large computers occupying the whole room and was used in encryption. When the World War II subsided, it was followed by the Cold war. Year 1957 is when the Soviet Union launches their Sputnik 1 and tests their intercontinental ballistic missile.  These caused the birth of Advance Research Project Agency (ARPA) under President Dwight D Eisenhower consists of America’s most brilliant people who successfully developed the first satellite of United States on 18 months. In order to secure the technology of United States, they also give rise to Defense Advance Research Project Agency (DARPA). In 1962, J.C.R. Licklider was chosen to be the head of ARPA’s research for military use of computer technology and he was the one who propose the idea of computers talking to one another. One of ARPA’s goals was to connect the mainframe to different universities in the country to communicate to each other using common protocol. ARPANET, a research development of ARPA, was behind the discovery of TCP/IP. These protocols were used to aid the problem currently faced by the project at that time. Later on, it was followed by other different discovery of protocols that was useful nowadays. When people began to imagine computers talking to one another, the web has been developed. Through, hypertexts, documents could be read from all over the globe since there are nodes that are link together. </p>
